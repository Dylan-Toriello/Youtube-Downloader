# Youtube-Downloader
Program that downloads and trims Youtube videos using the PyTubeFix library and OS library (To download it into the right directory)

Made the program so I can trim videos for a social media account, speeding up the process of getting the vidoes and trimming them and automating it instead of doing it manually. You can also name it in the program. 

Downloads the videos directly into the downloads folder
